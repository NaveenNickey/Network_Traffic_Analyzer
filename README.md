# 🛡️ Network Traffic Analyzer
# 📌 Description
Network Traffic Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed for analyzing network traffic captured in PCAP files. It extracts, processes, and visualizes key network metrics, helping cybersecurity professionals detect anomalies, potential security threats, and suspicious activities like port scanning.

This tool leverages Scapy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to efficiently parse network packets, compute protocol distributions, detect malicious traffic patterns, and provide insights into network communications.

# 🔥 Features
📊 Packet Analysis – Extracts source/destination IPs, protocols, and packet sizes.
🔍 Protocol Distribution – Identifies the percentage share of TCP, UDP, ICMP, and other protocols.
🚨 Port Scanning Detection – Detects potential port-scanning activities based on abnormal packet behavior.
📈 Traffic Visualization – Generates structured tables and visual representations of network traffic.
🛠 Customizable Thresholds – Allows users to set thresholds for scanning detection.

# ⚡ Technologies Used
Python
Scapy – Packet manipulation & network traffic analysis
Pandas – Data processing
Matplotlib – Visualization
TQDM – Progress tracking

# 🛡️ Use Cases
✔️ Security analysis & threat detection
✔️ Network monitoring & performance evaluation
✔️ Identifying unusual traffic patterns
